# Printful API v2 (Beta) Integration Guide

This guide explains how to use the new Printful API v2 for your Mesa project, focusing on catalog import, product availability, and automated order fulfillment.

---

## ðŸ›’ 1. Authentication & Setup

- **OAuth 2 Private Token**: Use Private Tokens (or Public Apps) with specific permissions ("scopes"). Create tokens in the [Printful Developer Portal](https://developers.printful.com/docs/v2-beta/#section/Authorization).
- **Required Headers:**
  ```http
  Authorization: Bearer <TOKEN>
  X-PF-Store-Id: <Store-ID>  # Only for account-wide tokens
  ```

---

## ðŸ“¦ 2. Catalog Import

- `GET /v2/catalog-products` â€“ List all catalog products with HATEOAS links.
- `GET /v2/catalog-products/{id}/catalog-variants` â€“ Get variants (size, color, stock) for a product.
- More endpoints for images, prices, availability, mockup styles, shipping regions, etc.
- To filter by region (e.g., Germany):
  - Use parameter `selling_region_name=germany` for `/catalog-products/{id}/catalog-categories`.

---

## âœ… 3. Product Publishing (Make Product Available)

1. Select a Printful catalog product â†’ Get a Variant ID (e.g., `catalog_variant_id`).
2. `POST /v2/files` â€“ Upload your print file (PNG/JPEG, at least 300 DPI).
3. `POST /v2/orders` â€“ Create an order directly at Printful (auto-publish if you don't need a shop flow).
   - In the body: `order_items` with `source: "catalog"`, `catalog_variant_id`, `file_ids`, `quantity`, `retail_price`, etc.

---

## ðŸ”„ 4. Automated Order Submission

- `POST /v2/orders` â€“ Send order to Printful as soon as it's created in Mesa. Response includes Printful Order ID.
- `PATCH /v2/orders/{order_id}` â€“ Update shipping address, `external_id`, or shipping method.
- `POST /v2/orders/{order_id}/confirmation` â€“ Confirm the order at Printful and start fulfillment.

---

## ðŸ”” 5. Webhooks â€“ Automatic Fulfillment

Enable webhooks for events like:
- `order_created`, `shipment_sent`, `catalog_stock_updated`
- `POST /v2/webhooks/{eventType}` with `url` and optional params (e.g., products)

**Example use cases:**
- `order_created` â†’ Set status in Mesa
- `shipment_sent` â†’ Send tracking info
- `catalog_stock_updated` â†’ Sync inventory

---

## ðŸ§© 6. Additional Endpoints

- `/v2/order-estimation-tasks`: Estimate costs & taxes for carts
- `/v2/shipping-rates`: Get shipping costs
- `/v2/countries`: List shipping regions
- `/v2/stores`: Get available stores (for account tokens)

## âœ… Mesa Integration Steps

| Step | Task |
|------|------|
| 1 | Create Private Token, set up token-based auth |
| 2 | `GET /catalog-products` â€“ Import catalog |
| 3 | For each product, fetch variants & images |
| 4 | Make products selectable in Mesa |
| 5 | On order, `POST /orders` with variant & file IDs |
| 6 | After order, `POST /orders/{id}/confirmation` |
| 7 | Implement webhooks for `order_created`, `shipment_sent` |

---

## âœ… Important for German Context

- Use `selling_region_name=germany` where appropriate
- Set shipping and prices in EUR
- Sync shipping countries & costs for Germany

---

## ðŸ›’ How Printful Sync and Order Fulfillment Works

### 1. Syncing Printful Products
- Admin triggers a sync in the dashboard.
- For each new Printful product, the admin selects an artwork to associate.
- The system:
  1. Saves the Printful product in the `pod_product` table (for reference/metadata).
  2. Creates a new product in the main shop catalog (using the same structure as regular products).
  3. Updates the selected artwork's `product_ids` to include the new product.
- The product is now available for sale in the shop frontend, just like any other product.

### 2. Customer Order Flow
- Customer browses the shop and buys a product (regular or Printful POD).
- When the order is created, the backend detects if the product is a Printful POD product (by metadata or reference).
- The backend creates a corresponding order in Printful via the Printful API (`POST /v2/orders`).
- Printful handles printing and shipping directly to the customer.
- Webhooks from Printful can update order status in your shop (e.g., shipped, delivered).

### 3. Testing the Flow
- Sync a new Printful product and associate it with an artwork.
- Verify the product appears in the shop and is linked to the artwork.
- Place a test order for the product.
- Confirm that an order is created at Printful and fulfillment proceeds automatically.

## Summary

With this setup, you can:
- Import Printful catalogs and make products available in Mesa
- Seamlessly trigger and manage orders at Printful
- Process automatic status updates via webhooks
