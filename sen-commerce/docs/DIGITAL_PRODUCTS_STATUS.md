# Digital Products Implementation Status

## ✅ What's Completed

### 1. **Digital Product Module**
- ✅ File upload system (up to 50MB)
- ✅ Supabase storage integration
- ✅ Database models for products and downloads
- ✅ Admin API endpoints

### 2. **Admin Interface**
- ✅ Digital Products listing page (`/admin/digital-products`)
- ✅ Upload new digital products
- ✅ Edit/delete functionality
- ✅ Widget in product detail page (shows digital products section)

### 3. **Customer Download System**
- ✅ Download endpoint (`/store/download/:token`)
- ✅ Token validation
- ✅ Download counting
- ✅ Expiration checking

### 4. **SendGrid Integration**
- ✅ Configuration added to `medusa-config.ts`
- ✅ Setup guide created

## ⚠️ What Needs Manual Setup

### 1. **Environment Variables**
Add to your `.env` file:
```
# SendGrid
SENDGRID_API_KEY=your_api_key_here
SENDGRID_FROM=noreply@yourdomain.com

# Store URL for download links
STORE_URL=http://localhost:8000
```

### 2. **Link Products to Digital Files**
Currently, you need to manually associate digital products with regular products:

**Option A: Use Product Metadata** (Recommended)
```javascript
// When creating/updating a product, add digital product IDs to metadata
{
  metadata: {
    digital_product_ids: ["dprod_123", "dprod_456"]
  }
}
```

**Option B: Use Product Tags**
- Tag products as "digital" 
- Use naming conventions

### 3. **Order Completion Handler**
The subscriber (`handle-digital-products.ts`) needs to be updated with your logic for determining which products have digital files.

## 🚧 Known Issues

1. **Workflow Syntax Error**: The complex workflow had syntax issues. Using a simpler subscriber approach instead.

2. **Product Linking**: Direct database links between products and digital products had issues with Medusa v2's module system. Using metadata as workaround.

3. **Email Sending**: The email sending part is stubbed out. You need to implement the actual SendGrid notification call.

## 📝 Next Steps

### 1. **Complete Product Association**
Edit `src/subscribers/handle-digital-products.ts` line 47-54 to implement your logic:
```javascript
// Example: Check if product has digital tag
if (item.product.tags?.some(tag => tag.value === 'digital')) {
  // Look up digital product by product ID or SKU
  const digitalProduct = await findDigitalProductForProduct(item.product.id)
  if (digitalProduct) {
    digitalProductIds.push(digitalProduct.id)
  }
}
```

### 2. **Test the Flow**
1. Upload a digital product
2. Create a regular product
3. Associate them (via metadata or your chosen method)
4. Place a test order
5. Check logs for download links
6. Test download endpoint

### 3. **Production Considerations**
- Set up proper SendGrid templates
- Use signed URLs for private files
- Implement download analytics
- Add customer "My Downloads" page
- Set up monitoring for failed deliveries

## 🎯 Quick Start Testing

1. **Upload a test file**:
   - Go to `/admin/digital-products`
   - Upload a small PDF

2. **Create a test product**:
   - Create a regular product
   - Add metadata: `{ "digital_product_ids": ["your_digital_product_id"] }`
   - Set price to $1 for testing

3. **Place an order**:
   - Add product to cart
   - Complete checkout
   - Check server logs for download link

4. **Test download**:
   - Copy the download URL from logs
   - Open in browser
   - File should download

The foundation is solid! You just need to complete the product association logic and test the full flow.
